TruthLens: Misinformation Detection Platform
Overview

TruthLens is an AI-powered web application inspired by my Cardiff University internship, where I analyzed large-scale social media data to detect misinformation and identify trends in public sentiment.

Users can input any text and receive a detailed analysis including:

Misinformation Risk Score (0–100)

Sentiment Detection (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

Topic Identification (3–5 Key Topics)

Keyword Extraction (Most Frequent Words and Phrases)

TruthLens helps users quickly assess the reliability of information, uncover hidden topics, and track trends over time.
