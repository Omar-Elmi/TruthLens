TruthLens: Misinformation Detection Platform
Overview

TruthLens is an AI-powered web application inspired by my Cardiff University internship, where I analyzed large-scale social media data to detect misinformation and uncover trends in public sentiment. TruthLens allows users to input any text and receive a detailed analysis including:

Misinformation risk score (0–100)

Sentiment detection (positive, negative, neutral)

Topic identification (3–5 key topics)

Keyword extraction (most frequent words and phrases)

This platform helps users quickly evaluate the reliability of textual information, uncover underlying topics, and track trends over time.
